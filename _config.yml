 Welcome to my academic website. You are probably here to see pictures of my cat. Otherwise, read on. 
 I am a second year computer science PhD student at Beihang University. I am advised by Baochang Zhang and Xianbin Cao and am a member of the Shenyuan Hornor College. 
 Previously I was a researcher at Baidu AI. 
 Feel free to contact me at sunhuixin@buaa.edu.cn.
